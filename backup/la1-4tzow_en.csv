The Aquarium and the Zoo are a walking distance. The staff is very nice and friendly. The room is very nice; clean, spacious, and the kitchenette comes with a sink of its own and microwave and fridge (you can either get your own utensils or rent theirs for a little fee). The toilet is very clean and shower has a nice door to be closed unlike the other ones with curtains that tend to gather bacteria. There is also a hair-dryer and soaps and lotion. A flat-screen TV is there and the room has a big window that lets the sunlight come in and can be opened and tilted. The only downside was the temperature was high during my visit and there is no A/C in the room but when i called the reception they immediately provided a ventilator which helped a lot. I will definitely come again :0)","","","First of all very good location; quiet, you can reach the bus #200 from Corneliusbruecke stop across the street, or the #100 from another stop a few meters down the street.

other Americans. First, the location is a little out of the way. There
are nicer hotels much closer to the u and s bahn stations. Second, when
I had a basic issue with my room the staff were really rude about it. I
was speaking to them in English, and when I walked away they were
talking about me in German, making negative references to "American
tourists". Well I understand German, so I knew exactly what they
were saying. In a six day stay, the hotel was never able to fix the
problem with the phone in my room. Their solution was that I just use my
cell phone. Well my American cell isn't cheap in Europe.","","","Rude staff! As an American tourist I would not recommend this hotel to

The hotel is modern and clean, as was the room in which I stayed, which, although not great, it offered all the amenities, including a small kitchen where you can prepare a free tea or coffee. Even the bathroom in the room was comfortable but not great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to the German capital, offering at an affordable price with all comforts and a very strategic location.","Nothing to report","","L'Hotel Lutzow è posizionato a soli 800 metri dal famosissimo Zoo di Berlino e a soli 200 metri dalla fermata dell'Autobus "Corneliusbrucke", che unisce i punti più "turistici" della città. La struttura è moderna e pulita, così come la camera in cui ho soggiornato, che, sebbene non grandissima, offriva tutti i comfort, compresa una piccola cucina dove potersi liberamente preparare un tè o un caffè. Anche il bagno in camera era confortevole ma non grandissimo. Consiglierei questo albergo a chiunque abbia in programma un viaggio nella capitale Tedesca, che offre ad un prezzo vantaggioso tutti i comfort ed una posizione decisamente strategica.","Nulla da segnalare","",

On the corner is also an excellent restaurant with Argentinian steak, which would also definitely recommend. The hotel itself has no objections, there is a kitchen where you can for 5 euro / day to rent dishes, and we had a room with a desk and a safe to store things. At the bottom of the hotel's café, where you can have tea with the experience we have, unfortunately, we were only in Berlin for 3 days.","The only thing that bothered us is that nearly all of Berlin under renovation, so you could hear drilling and banging in the room, but it is in the center, with some noise must be counted.","","Líbilo se nám, že je hotel blízko ZOO. A také jsou v jeho blízkosti obchodní centra, takže to není daleko na nákup, nejbližší supermarket je asi 150m od hotelu. Na rohu ulice je také výborná restaurace s argentinskými steaky, kterou bychom také určitě doporučili. K samotnému hotelu nemáme výhrady, je zde kuchyňka do které si můžete za 5 euro/den půjčit  nádobí, měli jsme i pokoj se psacím stolem a trezor na úschovu věcí. Ve spodní části hotelu je café, kde si můžete dát čaj zdarma, s tím bohužel zkušenost nemáme, byli jsme v Berlíně pouze na 3 dny.","Jediné co nám vadilo je, že je skoro celý Berlín v rekonstrukci, takže v bylo slyšet vrtání a bouchání až do pokoje, ale je to v centru města, s nějakým hlukem se počítat musí.","",

I am a loyal customer of booking.com, usually satisfied, I must say that during my stay in Berlin recently, I was rather disappointed. I chose a hotel on your site (Lutzow) because it was specifically located in the Mitte district of Berlin. While many hotels do not even mention the neighborhood, it stated Mitte ... a selling point because it is the tourist district where I also wanted to be housed. What was my surprise to see that was at the other end of town! Tiergarden ... in the neighborhood. The hotel people have confirmed to me that there was indeed an error and that they would correct the situation. You understand that having only a day and a half, we have not changed hotels but the situation has led us additional costs and inconvenience. After mentioning this error in bookin.com, people in the hotel have changed his tune, claiming to be part of Mitte-Tiergarten district. In short I am disappointed that booking.com lack of objectivity against the company and does not compensate in any way, however small whatsoever, his client. Because we base it happened that booking.com ensures that information it places on its website is accurate and precise.
It's all a question of credibility.Thank you for your attention.
Marie-Josée Taillefer","","","Bonjour à vous
Moi qui suis une fidèle cliente de booking.com, habituellement satisfaite, je dois vous dire que lors de mon séjour à Berlin récemment, j'ai été plutôt déçue. J'avais choisi un hôtel sur votre site (Lutzow) parce qu'il était spécifiquement situé dans le quartier Mitte de Berlin. Alors que plusieurs hôtels ne mentionnaient  même pas le quartier, celui-ci précisait Mitte...un argument de vente parce que c'est le quartier touristique où moi aussi je voulais être logé. Quel fut ma surprise de constater qu'on était à l'autre bout de la ville! ...dans le quartier tiergarden. Les gens de l'hôtel m'ont confirmée qu'il y avait bien une erreur et qu'ils allaient corriger la situation. Vous comprenez que n'ayant qu'une journée et demi, nous n'avons pas changé d'hôtel mais que la situation nous a entrainé des frais supplémentaires et des inconvénients. Âpres avoir mentionné cette erreur chez bookin.com, les gens de l'hôtel ont changé de discours en prétextant faire partie du quartier Mitte-tiergaten. Bref je suis déçue que booking.com manque d'objectivité face à l'entreprise et ne compense pas d'aucune façon, si minime que se soit, sa cliente. Parce qu'on fond, on se fit que booking.com s'assure que les infos qu'elle met sur son site sont exactes et précises.
