Этой же ночью было списано еще 200 евро, а вся сумма к оплате была 320 евро, однако девушка на ресепшн несколько раз убеждала нас, что все ок, это всего лишь блокировка и деньги на месте (но мы то видим, что их нет). При выселении сказали, что мы должны сначала заплатить, они разблокируют карту и деньги вернутся в течение 1-2 часов.
