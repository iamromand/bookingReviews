We had a bathroom with glass door, which was pretty cool, especially for a young couple ;) It was really nice place - they cleaned everyday and brought us fresh towels and mini - soups and shampoos! 
The hotel isn't exactly in city center, but it shouldn't be a problem to get somewhere in Berlin, it's very close to Kurfurstendamm as well :)) It's worth its price and I would highly recommend that place.

"Simone","Italy","","7.5","Good","7 September 2014","The hotel is a short walk from Ku'Damm known street full of shops and restaurants. The metro is very close, about 200 M, with a stop you're at the zoo and go anywhere. The rooms are cleaned every day and wanting all the towels are changed as well.
Excellent value for money.","On the other hand there is the fact that the railway runs right next to the hotel, with very frequent passage of trains even if the room is well insulated.
The bathroom does not have a real door, but a glass that serves as both a shower door that leads to the bathroom, comes to about 30 cm from the ceiling, then goodbye privacy, I would say somewhat original solution.
Last thing, in the stairwell smelled really unpleasant.","","L'hotel è a due passi da Ku'Damm, nota strada piena di negozi e locali. La metro è vicinissima, 200 M circa, con una fermata sei al giardino zoologico e vai ovunque. Le stanze vengono pulite ogni giorno e volendo vengono pure cambiati tutti gli asciugamani.
Ottimo il rapporto qualità prezzo.","Di contro c'è il fatto che la ferrovia passa proprio accanto all'hotel, con passaggio di treni molto frequenti anche se la stanza è isolata bene.
Il bagno non ha una vera porta, ma un vetro che serve sia da porta della doccia che da porta del bagno, arriva a circa 30 cm dal soffitto, quindi addio privacy, soluzione direi alquanto originale.

Приличные завтраки","Заявленное близкое расположение к kuddam не совсем соответствует действительности, идти примерно 5 кварталов до не самой оживленной части. Примерно такое же расстояние до zoo. 
Станция метро тоже довольно не близко, зато прям под окнами проходит линия железной дороги,  поэтому каждые 3 минуты ездит либо метро,  либо s-bahn, либо просто поезда. Если есть проблемы со сном- такое расположение-не вариант.

Advised","The only problem may be the fact that the bathroom door is glass mat, and does not reach the ceiling, so if you are not traveling with family privacy can be an issue.
Maybe it can be a bit noisy because the train passes very close to me, however, does not have bothered.
 The wi fi in the rooms there, but only in the lobby.","","l'hotel è un pò decentrato, zona zoo di berlino, ma proprio davanti c'è la fermata della S Bahn Savignyplatz quindi si raggiunge qualsiasi posto in poco tempo. La zona è ricca di locali, bar e ristoranti, soprattutto etnici.
Le stanze sono pulite e confortevoli, cosi come il bagno, un pò spartana la fornitura di prodotti da bagno, ma l'indispensabile c'è. 
Non ho provato la colazione, perchè un pò costosa, 10 euro, ma proprio dietro l'angolo c'è una panetteria molto carina.
Il personale è gentile e disponibile per informazioni o altro. 
Il rapporto qualità-prezzo è ottimo, noi abbiamo soggiornato per 50 euro a notte.
Consigliato","Unico problema può essere il fatto che la porta del bagno sia di vetro opaco, e non arriva al soffitto, pertanto se non si viaggia in coppia la privacy può essere un problema.
Forse può risultare un pò rumoroso perchè il treno passa molto vicino, a me comunque non ha dato noia.
 Il wi fi non c'è nelle stanze, ma solo nella hall.","",

I also had to claim a day because I did the room.The lights go straight and so, perhaps is to justify the name of the hotel in terms of energy saving.
Believe me, it is better to pay a little more and be in a less precario.Lo 3 star hotel awarded me this is a joke.

También tuve que reclamar un día porque no me hicieron la habitación.Las luces de la escalera van así asi,quizàs es por justificar el nombre del hotel en cuanto a ahorro de energia.
