we had a little scare on the morning of our checking out of the hotel,
the emergency alarm went off with the instructions over the pa system to
direct guests to leave our hotel room immediately due to a technical
problem/fire in a hotel. We had to evacuate by stairs from the 6th
floor to the street level, but everything turned out ok. This is the
first time it ever happened to us when we traveled & stayed at any
hotels. Having said that, we're glad that the hotel's emergency
system works really well to alert guests of any emergency situations
when it's necessary.

"Daniela","Italy","","8.8","Fabulous","13 August 2014","We stayed 9 nights in this hotel in August and we found ourselves really well. The hotel is very nice, new and comfortable. The rooms are clean and spacious, modern interior, lit by large windows, air-conditioning working properly, flat screen TV, kettle with tea bags, desk and wardrobe. The bathroom is new, very well equipped and with a lovely shower. The staff is friendly and helpful. I asked the reception to call a taxi and arrived in 3 minutes in front of the hotel. The lobby is nice and cozy, there are distributors with sandwiches, chips and drinks available, daily news on the weather and two computers to connect to the internet. The hotel location is good, despite being a bit 'more distant from the center is well connected to the metro station and a few meters and allows you to take the two lines (U2 and U7), the most important of Berlin, by which we arrive everywhere. Charlottenburg Palace instead is the nearest attraction, is a 10-minute walk away. The neighborhood is very lively, full of restaurants and supermarkets. Would definitely recommend this hotel which has an excellent quality / price ratio. It 'was a great choice, I would certainly return.","I liked everything. I'd like to just point out the things that could make the hotel perfect: firstly internet is too expensive, it should be free (but we we made a special rate in the cell, so we did not need the wifi of the hotel); missing a bar fridge in the rooms that would be very convenient to put the fresh water; the pillow of the bed is really scomodo..per Luckily I asked for a second pillow to the front desk and I joined them with the elastici..così 9 nights I slept very well:-)","","Abbiamo soggiornato 9 notti in questo hotel ad agosto e ci siamo trovati davvero bene. L'albergo è molto carino, nuovo e accogliente. Le camere sono pulite e spaziose, di arredamento moderno, illuminate da ampie vetrate, dotate di aria condizionata perfettamente funzionante, televisore a schermo piatto, bollitore con bustine per il tè, scrivania e armadio. Il bagno è nuovo, molto accessoriato e con una doccia bellissima. Il personale è gentile e disponibile. Ho chiesto alla reception di chiamarmi un taxi ed è arrivato in soli 3 minuti davanti l'hotel. La hall è bella e accogliente, ci sono dei distributori con tramezzini, patatine e bibite a disposizione, notizie quotidiane sul meteo e due computer per connettersi a internet. La posizione dell'hotel è buona, nonostante sia un po' più distante dal centro è ben collegato, la fermata della metro e a pochi metri e consente di prendere le due linee (U2 e U7) più importanti di Berlino, tramite le quali si arriva ovunque. Il castello di Charlottenburg invece è l'attrazione più vicina, si raggiunge in 10 minuti a piedi. Il quartiere è molto vivace, pieno di ristoranti e supermercati. Consiglio decisamente questo albergo che ha un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo. E' stata un'ottima scelta, ci ritornerei sicuramente.","Mi è piaciuto tutto. Vorrei dare solo segnalare delle cose che potrebbero rendere l'hotel davvero perfetto: innanzitutto internet è troppo caro, dovrebbe essere gratis (però noi ci siamo fatti una tariffa speciale nel cellulare, per cui non abbiamo avuto bisogno del wifi dell'hotel); nelle camere manca un minifrigo bar che sarebbe stato molto comodo per mettere l'acqua fresca; il cuscino del letto è davvero scomodo..per fortuna ho chiesto un secondo cuscino alla reception e li ho uniti con degli elastici..così ho dormito benissimo 9 notti :-)","",

This room has pleased a free safe and a spacious closet (for two at least).Pre-paid immediately the full amount for the room when we arrived, we were immediately given a check. No problems. We settled for 4 hours before the official check-in time - 15.00. There is a luggage storage.","If you just find fault with: faucet in the shower works somehow unevenly - nation alternately mixture of hot and cold water, but apparently, it all depends on the pressure.

Понравился дизайн, наличие чайных принадлежностей (чайник, кружки-ложки, бокалы для вина, чайные пакетики, пакеты с кофе-сахаром-сливками) - очень удобно. Также предлагается бутилированная вода, на первой бутылке не написано, но, если откроете, это будет стоить вам 3.90 евро.
Рядом все необходимые магазины, остановки общественного транспорта и кафешки с разнообразной кухней. Рядом красивый парк с дворцом Шарлоттенбург, в котором оч приятно завтракать солнечным утром. Район достаточно спокойный и милый - советую.
В номере порадовал бесплатный сейф и вместительный шкаф (для двоих по крайней мере).

"Zhanna","Russia","Family","7.9","Good","9 February 2014","Location is perfect. Metro within walking distance, direct line to Alexanderplatz, another direct line - to Spandau. Very comfortable ride and Potsdam.Located on Vilsmesdorfshtrasse on which a lot of places where you can eat (eg, opposite the hotel famous in Berlin store cooking Rogacki, where you can dine very well - hot soups, sausages, burgers, fish, side dishes, the portions are large, plus various salads Pts good pastries). The hotel is located a 3-5 minute walk from the metro Bismarckstraße.If you walk towards the subway Vilmesdorfshtrasse Vilmesdorfshtrasse the street, and there you can find a lot of big stores such as Vilmesdorfskie Arcade, Karstadt, Mahh and lots of small, plus all sorts of cafes, pastry shops. This so-called Vilmesdorfskaya shopping mile.Good place to walk - at the station Richard Wagner Strasse, is a station above Bismarshtrasse blue-line. There is Charlottenburg Palace, the square of which is carried out in the winter Christmas markets. Well, Spandau - the old town and the citadel, also blue line, of course, a good place for a stroll.As for the numbers, I want to note that it was warm, there were tea and coffee. Near the reception there is a desktop computer, you can use a short time, however, there's often a queue. In the evening quiet.Once decided to continue the banquet expensive female compatriots, but the staff quickly to straighten them, for that special thanks) Decent price when booking in advance.","Stayed in the hotel for the second time. For the first time unpleasantly amazed light walls with some black scratches and gray spots. But if in the previous issue it was in the hallway and it was clear that it looks like the marks of dirty baggage (???), the second time on the dirty walls were already all over the room.It seems to me that if you invite guests, the walls should be clean, and it was very unpleasant. Redecorating clearly needed. Second - no covers or at least polupokryvala on the beds. Given that in a double room, only one (!) Chair, we have to sit and lie on the bed linen.As a result, dirty linen, and a lot of dust. Furniture nonfunctional. Some incredible bedside tables without a single box. Table also without a single drawer. As I wrote, only one chair.Although space in the corridor enough, maybe the hotel is worth to put an inexpensive ottoman with storage compartment, so that it could sit down and put on the boots, and not to divide a single chair ?? And the second chair in the room as something quite out of place would be. In the bath there was no shower gel. But the bathroom was clean. This room has no fridge, if that.","","Месторасположение прекрасное. Метро в шаговой доступности, прямая ветка до Александерплатц, другая прямая ветка -- до Шпандау. Очень удобно ехать и до Потсдама. Отель расположен на Вильсмесдорфштрассе, на которой множество мест, где можно поесть (н-р, напротив отеля известный в Берлине магазин кулинарии Rogacki, где можно очень неплохо пообедать -- горячие супы, колбаски, котлеты, рыба,гарниры, порции большие плюс разные салаты и оч хорошая выпечка). Отель расположен в 3-5 минутах ходьбы от метро Бисмаркштрассе. Если идти по направлению к метро Вильмесдорфштрассе по улице Вильмесдорфштрассе, то там можно найти множество крупных магазинов , таких как Вильмесдорфские Аркады, Карштадт, Махх и множество небольших плюс всякие кафе, булочные-кондитерские. Это так называемая Вильмесдорфская торговая миля. Хорошее место для прогулок -- на станции Рихард Вагнер штрассе, это станция выше Бисмарштрассе на синей ветке. Там расположен замок Шарлоттенбург, на площади которого зимой проводят рождественские ярмарки. Ну и Шпандау -- старый город и цитадель, тоже синяя ветка, конечная, хорошее место для прогулок. 
Что касается самого номера, то хочется отметить, что он был теплый, были принадлежности для чая-кофе. Возле рецепции есть стационарный компьютер, ненадолго можно воспользоваться, правда, там часто очередь. По вечерам тихо. Один раз решили продолжить банкет дорогие женщины-соотечественницы, но персонал их быстро приструнил, за что отдельное спасибо) Неплохая цена при бронировании заранее.","Останавливались в отеле во второй раз. В первый раз неприятно поразили светлые стены с какими-то черными царапинами и серыми пятнами. Но если в предыдущем номере это было в коридорчике и было ясно, что это похоже следы от грязного багажа(???), то в о второй раз грязные стены были уже во всем номере. Мне кажется, что если приглашаешь гостей, то стены должны быть чистые, а то было очень неприятно. Косметический ремонт однозначно необходим. Второе -- отсутствие покрывала или хотя бы полупокрывала на кроватях. Учитывая, что в номере на двоих только один(!) стул, то приходится сидеть и лежать на постельном белье. В результате и белье грязное, и пыли много. Мебель нефункциональна. Какие-то невероятные тумбочки без единого ящика. Стол тоже без единого выдвижного ящика. Как я писала, всего один стул. Хотя места в коридорчике хватает, может, отелю стОит поставить недорогой пуф с ящиком, чтобы на него можно было сесть и одеть сапоги, а не делить один-единственный стул?? Да и стул второй в номере как-то совсем нелишним был бы. В ванне отсутствовал гель для душа. Но сам санузел был чистый. В номере нет холодильника, если что.","",
