Instead english french german spanish and maybe even Italian Japanese ... But nothing ...
Then an interesting anecdote and unpleasant they sent me a letter after two days where it was said that I had to pay 100 € for a special cleaning done in my room because I had smoked .. I tried to explain that I had not smoked in the room and asking how they could say this and the answer was the room he heard the pizza .. hallucinating ... So be careful if the waiter decide that you smoked you smoked and will cost 100 € ... I do not know about you but if you go to some local disco type where you smoke
Imagine the smell in the room after the days of smoke?
Ridiculous ...","","La posizione ottima... 15 minuti a piedi da Alexander plazt..

Poi un aneddoto interessante e sgradevole mi hanno mandato una lettera dopo due gg dove si diceva che dovevo pagare 100€ per una pulizia speciale fatta nella mia camera perché avevo fumato.. Ho tentato di spiegare che non avessi fumato in camera e chiedendo come facevano a dire questo e la risposta è stata la camera ha sentito la pizza.. ALLUCINATE ... Quindi fate attenzione se la cameriere decide che avete fumato avete fumato e vi costa 100€ ... Non so voi ma se andate in qualche locale tipo discoteca dove si fuma
Immaginate la puzza nella stanza il gg dopo di fumo?

- Bed and hotel rooms were really small.
(We only had two small pillows and two single blankets, our friends had four pillows and a huge blanket together)
However, WE had to pay just as much as our friends to the great room for the MINI rooms.
- & Gt; Rooms were booked by me together.
In addition, our shower was broken. (Shower head had WHILE showering be noted, as this would otherwise have only made the wall wet):-(
We are extremely disappointed that the hotel has taken on our complaint NOTHING to us but to beautify the stay even more.
It was briefly watched on demand in the computer according to whether a room is available.
In response I was told that the moment no rooms are clean. When I give the lady at the front desk for us to remember on a slip of paper, so that we can move to the next free and clean double room, I got the following answer: you have to try to contact us.
Also, we were not offered that the building technician looks at the shower to fix this.
Bins were unfortunately not cleaned.
UNBELIEVABLE !!!!
THIS COULD HAVE ME IN A 4 STAR HOTEL NOT EXPECTED.","","","Wir waren mit zwei Pärchen unterwegs. Unsere Freunde haben ein
Dopplzimmmer mit großem Bett und einem recht großen Hotelzimmer

- Bett und Hotelzimmer waren wirklich klein. 
(wir hatten nur zwei kleine Kopfkissen und zwei einzelne Decken, unsere Freunde hatten vier Kissen und eine riesen Decke zusammen) 
WIr mussten jedoch für das MINI Zimmer genau soviel bezahlen wie unsere Freunde für das große Zimmer. 
--> Zimmer wurden von mir zusammen gebucht.
Zudem war unsere Dusche kaputt. (Duschkopf musste wärend des duschens festgehalten werden, da dieser sonst nur die Wand nass gemacht hätte)  :-( 
Wir sind maßlos enttäuscht, dass das Hotel bei unserer Reklamation NICHTS unternommen hat, um uns den Aufenhalt doch noch zu verschönern. 
Es wurde auf nachfragen kurz im Computer nach geguckt ob ein Zimmer frei ist. 
Als Antwort bekam ich zu hören, dass Momentan kein Zimmer sauber sind. Als ich die Dame an der Rezeption geben habe, uns auf einem Zettel vor zu merken, damit wir in das nächste freie und saubere Doppelzimmer umziehen können, bekam ich folgende Antwort:Sie müssen sich schon bei uns melden.
Auch wurde uns nicht angeboten, dass sich der Haustechniker die Dusche anguckt um diese zu reparieren.
